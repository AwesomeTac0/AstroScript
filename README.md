# AstroScript
 Using Python and Android ADB this project lets you capture Astrophotography all night long

Please use latest ADB, required if using wireless mode with Android 11+.

Requirements for Python:
pip3 install PyAutoGui Pillow opencv-python

This script was made to make my life easier when taking Astro shots with my Pixel phones. I have tested this by taping a Pixel 4 XL to my roof and ran the script all night. 

Wireless mode with some sort of fast charger will be best. I ran a cable out my window to the phone. Using wired adb is fine but the discharge rate killed the phone before the night was done.

Might add web controls through Flask so you can click the image to 'tap' on the phone.
I can also add a method for using other remote screen share software like AnyDesk or Vysor. 
I have made that already but then you wouldn't be able to use your computer.
